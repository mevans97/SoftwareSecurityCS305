# SoftwareSecurityCS305
Final project from cs305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was artemis financial. As they modernize their web interface, they sought out a third party (Me) to implement modern software security to their application

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?


I effectively identified and addressed security vulnerabilities in the client's software by implementing measures such as adding checksum verification and using stronger cryptographic hashing algorithms. Secure coding is crucial as it prevents data breaches, protects sensitive information, and maintains user trust. Software security enhances a company's overall wellbeing by safeguarding its reputation, mitigating financial risks, and ensuring compliance with regulations. The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential attack vectors and prioritizing security measures based on risk assessment.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by adding checksum verification, utilizing stronger cryptographic hashing algorithms, and implementing proper error handling for algorithm unavailability. In the future, I would use a combination of automated vulnerability scanning tools, penetration testing, and code reviews to assess vulnerabilities comprehensively. These techniques would help prioritize mitigation techniques based on the severity of identified vulnerabilities and the specific needs of the software application.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured the code and software application were functional and secure by conducting thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security testing. After refactoring the code, I performed regression testing to check for any introduced vulnerabilities, along with code reviews and static analysis tools to identify potential security issues.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?


In future assignments or tasks, I may utilize resources such as security libraries, frameworks like Spring Security, and security-focused coding practices such as input validation, output encoding, and secure configuration management to enhance software security. Additionally, leveraging security testing tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite for dynamic analysis, along with static code analysis tools like SonarQube, can help ensure code quality and security.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?


For future employers, I could showcase the refactored code along with a summary of security enhancements made during the vulnerability assessment process. Additionally, I could provide documentation outlining the security measures implemented, such as adding checksum verification and upgrading hashing algorithms, demonstrating my ability to identify and address security vulnerabilities effectively. This assignment highlights my skills in secure coding practices, risk assessment, and software security enhancement, which are valuable assets for any organization concerned with protecting sensitive data and ensuring the integrity of their software applications.
